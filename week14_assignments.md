## In Class Assignment due Friday, Nov 20, 2020 @ 8pm
 - Optional: play around with the MinimumML notebook. Are there any techniques you've learned about that you can implement to make it less minimal?


## Homework due Wednesday, DEC 2, 2020 @ 5:30pm (Happy Thanksgiving!)
* [Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) 
    - Finish all Readings, Videos, and Quizzes for the following sections in [Week 5](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/5):
        - [Neural Networks: Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/5)

* [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)
    - Finish all Videos, Readings, Key Terminology, Playground Exercises, and Check Your Understanding for the following sections:
        - [Classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/video-lecture)
        - [Regularization: Sparsity](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/regularization-for-sparsity/video-lecture)
        - [Mutli-Class Neural Networks](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/multi-class-neural-networks/video-lecture)

* Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks - A notebook adventure
    - Before you start the notebook, read [An Initutive Explanation of Convnets](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/). We recommend referring back to it as you work.
	- Complete the [Fashion CNN Notebook](https://github.com/LaunchCoderGirlSTL/Data-Science-Assignments/blob/master/course_material/week_14/Fashion-CNN-Clean.ipynb)
	- Use [Keras Cheat Sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Keras_Cheat_Sheet_Python.pdf) if needed
	- This notebook will introduce you to lots of terms and techniques you might be unfamiliar with. You will likely need to use Google/documentation/study groups/Slack early and often!

* Optional Resources
 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning [e-book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
 - For those of you interested in learning more in-depth material about Neural Networks, we highly recommend the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). This is a 5 course series from Coursera which deals with implementing a set of state-of-the-art Neural Networks. This is well beyond the scope of CoderGirl- Data Science, but we wanted to keep this here as a reference.
